This file contains the report using data associated to the 15 regions of Chile under the 5 dimensions to: 

Perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for the dataset provided, and provide:
  - A ranking for each one of the five dimensions considered, such that regions are ranked within each (five rankings in total).
  - 5 to 7 regions to identify and present their main strengths and opportunity areas in a clear and structured manner. The report should describe the current status of each one of these regions, based on such strengths and opportunity areas. Assume that the client (the Ministry of Economic Development and Tourism of Chile) will consider your report to select a consulting firm to conduct this analysis further.

Also, based on the information that you will present in 1) and 2) above, plus the information presented in the WEF and OECD references available in this module, select two dimensions that the Chilean government should consider for further investment to improve tourism competitiveness nationwide.

This file contains the report using data associated to the 15 regions of Chile under the 5 dimensions to: 

(continued)

1. Perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for the new dataset provided, as presented in the video and complementary example available in the previous module, such that you can come up with a ranking for each one of the five new dimensions considered, such that regions are ranked within each (five rankings in total).

Recall that, to achieve this, you must clean up the data and replace any missing values; normalize the data such that the PCA works in an adequate and reliable manner; and once you run the PCA, and before presenting results, you should select the components that capture most of the variance.

While the main results for each of the five new dimensions should be presented first, your methodology and all values obtained (eigenvalues; eigenvectors; weights; results) should be presented in a clear and structured manner.

2. Based on your two analyses (all ten dimensions), select 3 to 5 regions to identify and present their main strengths and opportunity areas in a clear and structured manner, based on all of this data and information. Your report should describe the current status of each one of these regions, based on such strengths and opportunity areas.

3. Based on the information that you will present in 1) and 2) above, plus the information presented in the ‘WEF in post-COVID-19 in Latin America’ document, present a list of recommendations and priorities that the Ministry of Economic Development and Tourism of Chile could consider to support the tourism sector nationwide, after COVID-19.

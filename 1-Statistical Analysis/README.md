This file contains all problems related to Statistical Analysis including the topics such as: 

- statistical analysis; randomness; statistical experiment as check against randomness.Foundations of Probability Theory: random experiment; probability space; random variables; probability distributions, moments; conditional probability, independence and correlation as a measure of linear dependence; perfect correlation;

- Simulation of random variables; uniform distribution; pseudo-random variables: generating and testing; discrete and continuous random variables and their distributions; simulation of linear model

- Method of moments; estimands, estimators, estimates; limit theorems of probability theory; testing statistical hypotheses and defining confidence intervals; estimating mean and variance; method of moments for linear model

- Modeling relationships between variables: linear model framework; learning to think in terms of vectors and matrices: vectors, spans, bases, dot products and projections, orthogonal and orthonormal bases, matrices; linear model in matrix notations

- Least squares method for linear regression model; estimation of simple linear model; inference for simple regression model: distribution of the slope estimator, distribution of the intercept estimator, estimator of variance/standard deviation of residuals and its distribution, confidence intervals and hypotheses testing

- Regression ANOVA; categorical predictors; categorical response; logistic regression model: definition and interpretation

- Robustness of linear model; checking assumption about distribution of residuals; additive linear model with multiple predictors: geometric interpretation, orthogonal vs. non-orthogonal design, comparison of sub-models; more on logistic regression

- One-way ANOVA: ANOVA as linear model, utility test, geometric interpretation, orthogonal vs. non-orthogonal design; contrasts; pairwise comparisons; multiple comparisons

- Linear model with multiple responses and no predictors: reduction of dimensionality; eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix; PCA algorithm and interpretation of the results

- Two-Way ANOVA; more on contrasts: creating a contrast, orthogonality of contrasts, contrast direction vector and statistic for F-test, contrast for interaction; examples; ANOVA with factors with more than 2 levels; checking ANOVA model assumptions; stepwise regression.

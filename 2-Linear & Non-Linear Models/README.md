# Linear and Nonlinear Models for Business Application

- Topics: 
  - Review of statistical inference based on linear model, 
  - Extension to the linear model by removing the assumption of Gaussian distribution for the output (Generalized Linear Model)
  - Extension to the linear model by allowing a correlation structure for the model residuals (mixed effect models)
  - Extension of the linear model by relaxing the requirement that inputs are combined linearly (nonparametric regression, regime switches)

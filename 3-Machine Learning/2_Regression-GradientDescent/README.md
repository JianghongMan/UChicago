# Assignment 2 - Regression (gradient descent)

The goal of this assignment is to compare the performance of the normal equation to linear regression with gradient descent.
In order to speed-up the process of mini-batch gradient descent, this project will also be scaling our data. Dataset: bottle.csv

1. Data Cleaning & Exploratory AnalysisÂ¶ 
  -- visualize distributions & remove outliers 
2. Train & Test Split
3. Linear Regression with sklearn
4. Gradient Descent Mini-Batch
  -- cost function: MSE

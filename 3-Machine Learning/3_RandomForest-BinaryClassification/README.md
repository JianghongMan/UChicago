# Assignment 3 - Random Forest (Binary Classification)

This assignment will be working with a credit default data set. The data includes various features around financial history and demographic information. The target variable is "default payment next week", which is just a binary flag of whether a customer defaults on a payment in the next week.

This assignment will need to use the Random Forest Classifier from sklearn in order to build a classifier to predict if a customer is likely to default.  Dataset: default of credit card clients.xls

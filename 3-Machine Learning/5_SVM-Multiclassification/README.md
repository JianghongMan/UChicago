# Assignment 5 - Support Vector Machines (Multiclassification)

This project needs to use the SVC & LinearSVC classifiers from sklearn.svm. It also needs to use RandomForestClassifier to compare performance of this model to support vector machine models.

Dataset: UCI's Urban Land Cover Data Set
This is the classification of urban land cover with 9 different classes that are fairly balanced across train & test. Multi-scale spectral, size, shape, and texture information are used for classification.

1. Data Processing
2. Random Forest Classifier - Base Model
3. LinearSVM Classifier - Base Model
4. Support Vector Machine Classifier + Linear Kernel + Grid Search
5. Support Vector Machine Classifier + Polynomial Kernel + Grid Search
6. Support Vector Machine Classifier + RBF Kernel + Grid Search

# Assignment 8 - Sequence Processing

This project aims to detect the security breach by predicting suspicious access using an RNN model and the provided Logfile data.

Logfile data includes login information like LogID, Timestamp, Method, Path, Status Code, Source, Remote Address, User Agent etc. The last indicator in each row denotes breach(1) and no breach(0) which is the target variable.

# Bank Marketing Project

Abstract: 
This project aims to use classification tools to predict if the customer will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).

About the dataset: 
The Banking Dataset of different customers is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. 

Term deposits are a major source of income for a bank. Your money is invested for an agreed rate of interest over a fixed amount of time, or term. The bank has various outreach plans to sell term deposits to their customers such as email marketing, advertisements, telephonic marketing, and digital marketing. Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective way to reach out to people. However, they require huge investment as large call centers are hired to actually execute these campaigns. Hence, it is crucial to identify the customers most likely to convert beforehand so that they can be specifically targeted via call.

Steps:

1. EDA - Use Python basics, Data Science libraries (Numpy, Panda), and Data Visualization Libraries(Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc.) to 
  1) A summary of your exploratory data analysis and findings with bullet points at the beginning of the Jupyter Notebook;
  2) Perform descriptive analytics on all variables to help understand the data, the
distributions and basic info (e.g.: value_counts(), .describe() for numeric variables: Mean, Standard Deviation, Median, Min, and Max, etc.);
  3) Choose at least one proper plot type to perform data visualization on each of all the variables;
  4) Organize your coding work step-by-step with comments.

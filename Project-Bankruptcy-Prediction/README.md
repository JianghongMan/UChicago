# Project -- Bankruptcy Prediction 

- Overview: This project aims to assess the financial condition of a company and predict whether this company will go bankrupt in order to help stakeholders make significant decisions concerning the relationship with companies.

- Steps: 
  - EDA
  - Feature Engineering 
    - correlation
  - Modeling 
    - SMOTE for imbalanced datq
    - K-Fold cross validation 
    - Classification Models
      - Logistic Regression
      - Random Forest
      - ANN
      - Gradient Boost
      - Ada Boost
      - XGBoost
  - Model Evaluation and Selection 
- Takeaways and Conclusion:
  - Top 5 most important features
  - Gradient Boosting performed the best and gave the highest accuracy
  - However, all other models performed very well with very close accuracy scores compared with Gradient Boost
  - All models (except for Random Forest) have slightly higher training accuracy scores than test accuracy scores, which might indicate overfitting issue but not severe

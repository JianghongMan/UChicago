# Ecommerce website recommendation engine and AI solution

- Overview: This project aims to develop a “Recommendation Engine” AI solution for a Website using an Unsupervised segmentation/clustering approach complete with economic analysis and presentation to management to convince the CMO and Webmaster to implement the solution. 

- Description: An ecommerce website currently recommends “most popular” items to all users with the hope that users will add items to their shopping cart and increase the size of each purchase. This approach is successful by increasing sales for the website and the current CMO/Webmaster do not believe there is a more intelligent solution that is more relevant to each users based on their prior purchases and relationship with the ecommerce website.

- Data: Ecommerce Data Set: Online Book RFM Data

- Part 1: 
 - Perform descriptive statistics on all variables to help understand the data, the distributions and basic info. (Mean, Standard Deviation, Median, Min, Max and Histogram)
  - Create a new data set with more descriptive labels and the data needed for analysis
  - Document the problem you will address using the SMART framework – use hypothetical data and goals for the improvement your Recommendation Engine will deliver
  - Select from a pool of titles and roles within the company to create a core team (Maximum 6-8 members) to perform the analysis and develop the pitch to your CMO. 
  - Describe the team strengths and discipline focus areas that justify your need for each person and why this talent will be necessary for your success. 
  -  Choose either a “supervised” or an “unsupervised” approach to segment/cluster current customers using the data provided.    
  - Create sample data (5-10 records) with synthetic data to show how a new transaction will be scored and assigned to a segment/cluster. (RFM<Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value>, K-Means or other rules based approached.

- Part 2:
  - Assume your approach delivers +20% incremental sales from the most engaged 15% of customers while delivering a statistically significant improvement (3-5%) on other segments, which is not expected to be sufficient to get the CMO/Webmaster to allow the change of algorithm for all portions of the customer base. However, you believe the CMO/Webmaster will accept your approach for the top 15% of customers.
  - Develop a presentation and video that helps the CMO/Webmaster to make the best decision for their organization based on your analysis. Create a data driven argument using hypothetical results to show your influence skills to convince the client to make the best decision – deciding whether that includes all segments or only the top 15%.

# Global Temperature Prediction -- Time Series Project

- Overviews: Made a 3-year prediction of the monthly global earth surface temperature using time series forecast models, checked stationarity using ACF and PACF plots, chose the model based on AICc and RMSE, and achieved a 97.05% F1 score.

- Takeaways: 
  - According to the prediction, in year 2016, the global temperature would have raised 1.38°C between 1753 (the earliest record) and 2016. 
  - In addition, the one-year temperature raise from 2015 to 2016 is estimated to be 0.32°C.

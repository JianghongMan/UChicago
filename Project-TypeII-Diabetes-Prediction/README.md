# Type II Diabetes Prediction Project

## Data:

This data contains 20+ files which contain the potential factors causing Type 2 Diabetes. 

See 'PracticeFusionDataSetDictionary.pdf' for more data description. 

## Content: Code

1. Processed 20 + files and engineered 10 usable features on the ‘De-identified Patient’ dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis and software tool Weka to accurately identify patients with a diagnosis of Type II diabetes;

2. Solved data imbalance with stratification and SMOTE techniques;

3. Achieved a final 0.08 Brier score and 97.6% accuracy by exploring Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Boost Classifier, and neural network models, and detecting the deterministic attributes causing Type II Diabetes.
